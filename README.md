# Flavors of Cacao Data Analysis
## Installations
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
## Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Chocolate Bar Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings) dataset found on Kaggle to better understand:
* Which country is the largest producer of chocolate
* How does the cocoa percentage in chocolates affect ratings
* How does the production of chocolate vary based on type (normal or dark)
* Which country has the highest ratings
* How does the cocoa percentage affect the ratings in different countries
* How have the ratings for different types of chocolates changed over time 
## File Description
There is one jupyter notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed.
## Medium Blog Post
The main findings can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@ksheerjaseth0502/a32917faba19).
## Acknowledgments
Acknoledgment should go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).These ratings in the dataset were compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. For up-to-date information, as well as additional content (including interviews with craft chocolate makers), please see his website: [Flavors of Cacao](http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html).
